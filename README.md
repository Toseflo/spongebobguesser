I made a little game where you get a random screenshot of SpongeBob SquarePants and you have to guess which episode it is from.

Play the game at https://toseflo.github.io/spongebobguesser/

Thanks to V3ctoor for making the code of his Avatar Guesser game public.

## How to add new screenshots:

1. I used the webiste https://fancaps.net/tv/showimages.php?4061-SpongeBob_SquarePants_Season_1 to get the screenshots for the game
2. Save the screenshots in the screenshots folder with subfolders named S*xx*E*yy*P*z* for the season, episode and part in the episode
3. Add the complete title to titles.txt
4. Run the python script with the correct paths
5. The website should now show the new images
